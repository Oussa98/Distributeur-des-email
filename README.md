# Distributeur-des-emails 

This program was a response to a competition organized by my uni.
It reads a specific .xlsx files with special header and send the information via emails to the students.

Technologies used:

    Python3 and these modules:
    PyQt5 (for the GUI)
    Openpyxl (For reading .xlsx)
    smtplib (for sending emails via Simple Mail Trasfer Protocol)
    Email (For formating email content)
    PyInstaller (for building the .exe file)
    
    
the .exe file is availible at but I recommend building it yourself because of the sensitive informations.
