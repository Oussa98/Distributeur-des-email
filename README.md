# Distributeur-des-emails 

This program was a response to a competition organized by my uni.
It reads a specific .xlsx files with special header and send the information via emails to the students.

Technologies used:

    Python3 and these modules:
    PyQt5 (for the GUI)
    Openpyxl (For reading .xlsx)
    smtplib (for sending emails via Simple Mail Trasfer Protocol)
    Email (For formating email content)
    PyInstaller (for building the .exe file)
    
    
the .exe file for windows X64 is availible at MediaFire but I recommend building it yourself because of the sensitive informations.

Google changed their policy and it started granting 500 email daily when you send them manually.
but when sending emails via a program (SMTP server) it will grant you only 100 emails daily.
